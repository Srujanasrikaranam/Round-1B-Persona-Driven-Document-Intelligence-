Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to build and run the Docker container for the Persona-Driven Document Intelligence project.



 Step 1: Build Docker Image

From the root of the project directory, run:

    docker build -t doc_intel .

Step 2: Run the Container

Mount the input and output folders and execute the main script:

    docker run -v $(pwd)/sample_input:/app/sample_input \
               -v $(pwd)/sample_output:/app/sample_output \
               doc_intel

This will run the pipeline on the sample_input PDFs and write the result to sample_output/challenge1b_output.json.

 Notes

- Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- The process will finish within 60 seconds for 3â€“5 documents.
- Output JSON will appear in the `sample_output/` folder.
